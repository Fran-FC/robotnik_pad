## Node Description
The `robotnik_pad_node` loads plugins that specify the desired behaviour. This allows you to load different plugins depending on your needs. Besides, it is possible to create your own plugins.

### How To Launch it
```bash
roslaunch robotnik_pad robotnik_pad.launch
```

This will launch two nodes: 
- joy: This node is in charge of reading from the joystick and publish the information (sensor_msgs/Joy) through a topic
- robotnik_pad_node: This node will load the different plugins included in the config file

### How To Prepare The Config File
This an example of a config file loading a single plugin: 

```yaml
plugins: 
  - TwistMovement

TwistMovement:
  type: robotnik_pad_plugins/Movement
  scale_linear: 1.5
  scale_angular: 3
  cmd_topic_vel: cmd_vel
  config: 
    button_deadman: 5
    axis_linear_x: 1
    axis_linear_y: 0
    axis_angular_z: 2
    button_speed_up: 3
    button_speed_down: 1
    button_kinematic_mode: 7
```

First of all you need to define a list containing the different plugins you want to load. Then, for each of the plugins you want to load, you should specify its parameters.
